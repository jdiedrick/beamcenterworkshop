For the Making Musical Instruments workshop, we will present a short series of movement exercises that demonstate the musical potential of the human body through body movement and body touch, facilitated through a simple variable resistive circuit.


In this repo you will find:

-Schedule

-Pure data patches

-Arduino code

Overview:

We will demonstrate the potential of turing the body into a musical instrument through a short performance. We will explain breifly how the circuit works, and the different between a discreet touch versus strength of touch and body area coverage. 

We will do a number of fun movement exercises, as well as show off different potential modes of body movement and touching: 

-1 to 1

-1 to Many

-Many to Many

As well as different audio synthesis methods that can be used depending on what kind of movement and touch you want to use:

- nime first insturment

- simple synth with additional modulation

- hits and samples

- sequencer

- bpm/filter modulation

-pre sequenced melody

-sample playback

At the end, we will have the students present 1 minute short presentations.
