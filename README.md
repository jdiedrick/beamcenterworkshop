For the Making Musical Instruments workshop, we will present a short series of movement exercises that demonstate the musical potential of the human body through body movement and body touch, facilitated through a simple variable resistive circuit.

In this repo you will find Pd/Max patches and Arduino code, as well as details for the Arduino circuit.

Overview:

We will demonstrate the potential of turing the body into a musical instrument through a short performance. We will explain breifly how the circuit works, and the different between a discreet touch versus strength of touch and body area coverage. 

We will do a number of fun movement exercises, as well as show off different potential modes of body movement and touching: 

- 1 to 1

- 1 to Many

- Many to Many

As well as different audio synthesis methods that can be used depending on what kind of movement and touch you want to use:

- Pentatonic scale

- Simple synth with additional modulation

- Hits and samples

- Sequencer

- BPM/filter modulation

- Presequenced melody

- Sample playback

At the end, we will have the students perform short presentations.

For the circuit, we use one 1M resistor (Brown, black, green, gold)
